Yamm client install
===================

Prerequisite
------------

First step is install CLI Daemon module. On a linux environment you shoud have no
surprises.

Read carefully the install directives of module. Don't forget the database patch
for Drupal.

Consider augmenting the PHP-cli maximum allowed memory, something like 256M
should be large enough for small sync operations.

Installing Yamm client
----------------------

Just enable yamm_client module.

Then, go to Administer > Yamm > Server and set the "Server URL" to whatever is
the master's http canonical host name.
