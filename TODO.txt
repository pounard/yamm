==============

Latest stuff (important)
------------------------
 * Create a view filter which says "update is more recent than last uuid". This
   will allow incremental updates. Dependency fetching should also be capable of
   returning such message as "entity has not been updated" instead of sending
   pragmatically all dependencies.
 * Handle properly object deletion on client side (clean uuid). This means more
   Drupal hooks implementation for common types.
 * Client should check for DNS/server base url matching when receiving an order
   to avoid security issues or DDoS attacks.
 * When pushing to a client, allow site admin to select profile.
 * Allow admin to select a default profile per client.
 * Content copy should not be required, and node export should fail if type is
   unknown and content copy is disabled.
 * Client error reporting should be more precise, and should give back erroneous
   entity uuid to server, plus a message or an error code.
 * Implement a view display plugin in order to ensure our views are meant to be
   used with profiles.
 * Finish views sharing (should be a fun feature!).
 * If server is configured to change users password, and send the configured
   client user password, it should also update its own configuration to be able
   to send it data later.
 * Server profile handling should be rewrote in order to match new naming
   conventions.

Done
----
 * Add last update time into yamm_uuid table.
 * Change "server" configuration option in client by "allowed servers" with a
   list or one or more server.
 * Add the server url in client transaction table.
 * Server should send its own base url as a parameter when pushing the order to
   client so the client would now on which server it should fetch data.

Client handling
---------------
 * Add profile select box into client overview page for pulling
 * Implement reporting on jobs (number of object saved/updated)

All
---
 * Implement hook_requirements() for tricky part configuration checks
     - Check server has (default) profile
     - Check server has client(s)
     - Check client has server

Server
------
 * Spec and implement a scheduler using hook_cron()

Cron
----
 * For server, purge old transactions
 * For client, check jobs has timeouted, and clean them
