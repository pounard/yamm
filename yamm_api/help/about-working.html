<h3>Push/pull mechanism and dependency fetching</h3>

<p>Yamm is network oriented. Objects fetching is base on a <b>push/pull</b>
mechanism. This push/pull mechanism relies on a custom <b>DataSync module</b>
job.</p>

<p>Server <b>pushes</b> the synchronization order to the client, client responds
OK if it is ready. Then, it creates the DataSync job. DataSync is scheduled
using the Drupal <i>hook_cron()</i>, and will launch a <i>PHP CLI thread</i> on
system which will launch the custom job.</p>

<p>The job when created will <b>pull</b> the server the main data to synchronize
(the objects referenced by your custom views) N times, until all objects have
been sent. During pulling, server will create an <b>Entity</b> abstraction object
for each piece of data, serialize it, and send it to the client.</p>

<p>Until the network pulling stays unfinished, the client, with the help of the
<i>EntityParser</i> which will iterate over all entities, and will create a
dependency tree recursively, pulling the server again for each new sub tree it
finds.
<br/>
During this parsing operation, the Yamm_EntityParser will also check for circular
dependencies, and will not allow the same object to be saved or updated twice.

<h3>Incremental updates</h3>

<p>During the process, the main data which allow Drupal sites to synchronize is
passed through the Yamm_Entity object, it's a standard <b>V4 UUID</b>. Each Drupal
supported object will have its own generated UUID on server, whatever its type
is. These UUID, server generated are stored into the Yamm_Entity object, and will
help the client to know, for each object it processes, if he has to create a new
one, or update an existing one.</p>

<p>Both client and server store their own UUID registry. The server stores the
UUID it generates, the client stores the UUID the server gave him.</p>
