<p><b>Yamm</b> is a tool suite that allow you to do massive and scheduled
data migration between Drupal sites.</p>

<p>It provides three packages, a client called <i>yamm_client</i>, a server
called <i>yamm_server</i> and a common API package which is <i>yamm_api</i>.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>You can handle a list of <i>clients</i>, each client is a remote Drupal
instance you want to synchronize. You associate them with <i>profiles</i>. Each
profile is a container for a <i>view</i> list.<br/>
The core synchronization is based on these views, each object referenced by
those will be synchronized, it's up to you to build the right views.</p>

<p>The synchronisation core algorithme uses a fully OO (<i>Object Oriented</i>)
code. Which provide strong error handling using <i>exceptions</i> and a total
abstraction for entities to synchronize.</p>

<p>This synchronization framework is able to construct large dependency tree
between objects, and will allow the clients to automatically fetch the needed
dependencies, even if you did not referenced them in views.</p>

<p>Right now, the core handle a short list of different entites, which are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nodes</li>
  <li>Content type (as a node dependency)</li>
  <li>Taxonomy terms</li>
  <li>Taxonomy vocabularies (as a term dependency)</li>
  <li>Users</li>
</ul>
