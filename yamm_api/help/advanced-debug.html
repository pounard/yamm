<h3>Debug synchronisation job</h3>

<p>In <b>Administer &gt; Yamm &gt; Common options</b> you will find the
<cite>Debug mode</cite> option. By enabling this option, <cite>Entity
parser</cite> will provide <b>a lot</b> of output.</p>

<p>You can find this output in two different places:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Watchdog</dt>
  <dd>Go to <b>Administer &gt; Reports &gt; Recent log entries</b> to find
  them logged through watchdog.</dd>

  <dt>Raw output with DataSync</dt>
  <dd>If you are manually running DataSync in CLI mode with its debug option in
  command-line arguments, the <cite>Entity Parser</cite> will output all its
  debug into <em>stdout</em>. Note that it will also log it to watchdog.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you enable the <cite>DataSync backtrace</cite> module, which is currently
in active development, you should also be able to catch a lot of DataSync events
and associated PHP errors or exceptions through DataSync admin settings pages.
</p>

<h3>Run massive test and wipe them out</h3>

<p>In <b>Administer &gt; Yamm &gt; Common options</b> you will find the
<cite>Clean state</cite> button. The submit function behind will run the
<cite>hook_yamm_api_clean()</cite>, which per default will wipe out all
DataSync jobs that any enabled <cite>Yamm</cite> submodule could have
queued.</p>
