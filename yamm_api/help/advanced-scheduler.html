<p>Yamm module embed a server-side scheduler which will allow you to send
scheduled synchronization orders to clients.
<br/>
This scheduler is implemented using a DataSync job (may be a simple cron
run in future, but always prefer the DataSync job if you can use it).
<br/>
The job is simple, it sends a push order to all registered clients that
have are in <i>activated</i> state.</p>

<p>To use it, enable the <b>Yamm scheduler</b> module, on the server Drupal
instance.
<br/>
To schedule the job execution, <b>refers to DataSync module documentation</b>
on how to set up a scheduled job.</p>
