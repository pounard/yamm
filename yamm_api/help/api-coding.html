<p>There is some caveat about Drupal coding conventions, here's an exhaustive
list of coding convention we bypass:</p>

<dt>String concatenation</dt>
<dd>
  The fact is Drupal 6 coding convention asks for:
  <pre>$str = 'static'. $dynamic .'static'</pre>
  We always do string concatenation like this:
  <pre>$str = 'static' . $dynamic . 'static'</pre>
  Which is the way of Drupal 7.
</dd>

<dt>CamelCase in classes</dt>
<dd>
  Drupal would do:
  <pre>
    class some_class {
      public function hello_world() { }
      // See here name collision
      protected function _hello_world() { }
      private function _hello_world() { }
    }</pre>
  Zend would do:
  <pre>
    class SomeClass {
      public function helloWorld() { }
      // Name collision avoided
      protected function _helloWorld() { }
      private function __helloWorld() { }
    }</pre>
  Which is we always do. Only for real OOP code. We still keep the 2 spaces
  indent size.
</dd>

<dt>PHPdoc</dt>
<dd>
  Drupal tells you to do:
  <pre>
    /**
     * My function does this, and it's pretty cool!
     *
     * @param $lolz
     *   Mixed array of stuff that makes my lol catz!
     * @param $catz
     *   The catz cited above
     * @param $killall = FALSE
     *   (optional) Should I kill the kitten
     * @return
     *   Some value you probably already hate
     */</pre>
  Zend would tell you to do:
  <pre>
    /**
     * My function does this, and it's pretty cool!
     *
     * @param array $lolz
     *   Mixed array of stuff that makes my lol catz!
     * @param LolCatz $catz
     *   The catz cited above
     * @param boolean $killall = FALSE
     *   (optional) Should I kill the kitten
     * @return SomeType
     *   Some value you probably already hate
     */</pre>
  Which is somewhere more likely because some IDEs will use this information
  to do better code completion and code folding.
  <br/>
  This won't hurt your Doxygen.
</dd>

<dt>LIMIT in SQL queries</dt>
<dd>
  You will see a lot of
  <pre>SELECT 1 FROM {some_table} WHERE [some conditions] LIMIT 1</pre>
  Drupal would tell you to use <i>db_query_range()</i>, but in our case, there
  is no need for this. The <i>SELECT 1</i> (or often <i>TRUE</i> is a way to
  determine if an object exists in database. The <i>LIMIT 1</i> is a a
  performance fix to ensure our DBMS won't fetch useless results.
</dd>

<p>You don't like it, this is none of our business. Those standards are here for
proper code readability. Zend coding standards are only used for PHPdoc (full
module wide), and OOP parts.</p>
