<h3>Manually run the push order</h3>

<p>We are going to manually run synchronization order.
<br/>
Go to the client list page, in the <i>Operations</i> row cell, click on
<i>Overview</i>.</p>

<p>On the new page, in the <i>Push method</i> fieldset, select <i>Full content
synchronization job</i>. Press the <i>Push</i> button.</p>

<p>If client was correctly set-up, you'll see the message <i>New transaction
created, waiting for client to finish.</i></p>

<h3>What happens, my client does nothing!</h3>

<p>In fact, this is quite normal. The push order makes the client create a new
DataSync job. This job will be ran when you configured DataSync to do it,
default DataSync behavior is to run the system PHP CLI thread as soon as it can,
understand at next client side cron run.</p>

<p>You can monitor your client job by going to the DataSync jobs queue list on
client administration pages. This list is updated at job runtime, you should be
able to see its current status, if errors happens, etc..</p>

<p>After you ran the push order, to see results you'll need to run client side
cron until the queued job in DataSync job list is in <i>Running</i> state.
<br/>
Because all the job works in a single SQL transaction, you won't see any results
if the job fail, or until the job has finished properly.</p>

<h3>Some notes</h3>

<p>If you push the syncrhonization order many times, the client will send an OK
status the first time, then a fail status all the others, until it finished or
failed the first one you created. To manually cancel a ghosted job, you'll have
to use Drush in order to cancel it properly, and clean the client transaction
database to free the client.</p>
